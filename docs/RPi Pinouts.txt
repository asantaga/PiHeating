The GPIO pins used in the code

Depending on your use you can choose from the following LEDs
I consider H_ON,HBEAT and Power to be the only mandatory LEDS. The rest , including the buttons are optional based on your needs

If you want to change these you can do so in the code in heatinggpio.py


# LED's

B_OFF = 04  # Boiler off LED
H_ON  = 17  # Heat On LED
H_OFF = 18  # Heat Off LED
C_OK  = 22  # Cube OK LED
C_ERR = 23  # Cube Error LED
HBEAT = 27  # HEARTBEAT LED

# Momentary buttons

ON_OFF = 05 # Boiler ON/Off button
CHECKH = 06 # Manual Valve check button
SHUTDOWN = 12   # Shutdown RPi button
REBOOT   = 11   # Reboot RPi button

# Relay output driver

BOILER_SW= 07   # Boiler relay switch output

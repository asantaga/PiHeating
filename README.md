# PiHeating
python code for Raspberry Pi Heating control

RPi Python Software to switch on a wireless controled boiler depending on what states the valves are in on the MAX Radiator Thermostats.

The message gets to the Boiler via a Vera home automation unit and Mysensor 433Mhz transmitter node.

Basic, and I do mean that, Instructions can be found in /PiHeating/src/heating/installation.txt and crontab instructions.txt

made changes to the basic folder layout to make it easier to install on Raspberry. CD into your home directory on Pi then
git clone the files in from the link provided by Git. This will create a PiHeating folder with the required files inside.
